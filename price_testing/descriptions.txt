A: The letter A is signed by holding up your dominant hand in a fist, facing outward, with the thumb sticking up to the side of the fist. This looks like the small letter 'a', but upside down, where the thumb sticking up reminds you of the serif sticking out the side of the small letter 'a'.
B: The letter B is signed by holding up your dominant hand open, with palm facing out and all 4 fingers standing straight and kept together, while tucking your thumb into your palm. This somehow resembles the small letter 'b'.
C: The letter C is signed by curving your open, dominant hand just like the letter 'C', where the top 4 fingers held together make up the top curve, and the thumb makes up the bottom curve.
D: The letter D is signed by holding up your dominant hand, curving your middle, ring, and pinkie fingers together and touching them to your thumb, while only your index finger is standing upright.
E: The letter E is signed by holding up your dominant hand, palm facing out, with your top 4 fingers all touching each other and tightly curved in, while your thumb is also curved and tightly tucked into your palm, touching the tips of the fingers above.
F: The letter F is signed by holding up your dominant hand, palm facing out, with your index finger and thumb touching, while your 3 other fingers are held up and spread apart. Make sure to form a circle with your thumb and index finger touching. Otherwise, if you flatten out your thumb and index a bit more, it will look like you are signing the number '9'.
