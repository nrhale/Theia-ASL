NOTE: CURRENTLY NOT BEING USED. REPLACE WITH JSON SAVING

The user txt files will be used to load and save user data. This may be replaced by React methods in later uses, but
was created now so that certain functionalities of the project could be implemented. A user text file can be made for
each user. There may be a new page for this upon using the app if we stick with this method.

Currently the user txt files follow this format. Note, the first word specified what kind of data it is to the
program. This information will be loaded in via object construction containing all necessary data. Object information
will be changed throughout using the application and then saved upon certain events (learning sign, completing
assessment, etc.)

username *username*
sign *sign_name* *number of times tested* *accuracy*
module *module name* *high score game 1* *high score game 2* etc.
